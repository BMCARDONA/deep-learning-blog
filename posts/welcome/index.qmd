The first post in my deep learning blog. Welcome!

My name's Bradley, and I'm a recent college graduate and deep learning practitioner. For the last few months, I have been spending much of my time learning about deep learning, in addition to machine learning and artificial intelligence, more broadly. My aim for this blog is threefold: to explore the technical developments of deep learning -- from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networds (RNNS), to Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Large Language Models (LLMS) -- to talk through my own personal projects, and, most importantly, to explore the ethical implications of the field as a whole, on the world at large. I am brimful of energy to be entering into this conversation; I have had many thoughts about deep learning for a while now, and am eager to express my own viewpoints on the subject.
